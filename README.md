# Job Recommendation Microservice

This microservice provides job recommendations based on user skills using a content-based recommendation system. It's built with FastAPI and uses TF-IDF and cosine similarity for generating recommendations.

## Features

- Get job recommendations based on user skills
- Update the recommendation model with new job data
- Dockerized for easy deployment
- Built with FastAPI for high performance
- Uses scikit-learn for TF-IDF and cosine similarity calculations
