Here's how you can convert the README.md content into a Jupyter Notebook format. In a Jupyter Notebook, you'll use Markdown cells for the textual content and code cells for code snippets. Here's an example of how to structure it:

```markdown
# Job Recommendation Microservice

This microservice provides job recommendations based on user skills using a content-based recommendation system. It's built with FastAPI and uses TF-IDF and cosine similarity for generating recommendations.

## Features

- Get job recommendations based on user skills
- Update the recommendation model with new job data
- Dockerized for easy deployment
- Built with FastAPI for high performance
- Uses scikit-learn for TF-IDF and cosine similarity calculations

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Docker (optional)

### Local Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/job-recommendation-service.git
cd job-recommendation-service
```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

### Docker Setup

1. **Build the Docker image:**

```bash
docker build -t job-recommendation-service .
```

2. **Run the Docker container:**

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 job-recommendation-service
```

The service will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.
